Have you ever looked at a long PDF and wished you could just ask it a question instead of reading the entire thing?

That is exactly what this app lets you do.

You can upload any PDF file, ask a question in simple language, and the app will give you a smart answer based on the actual content inside the PDF.
It is like chatting with your notes or documents.
